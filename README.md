# blackjack
My original blackjack game to test intermediate JavaScript knowledge and DOM manipulation.

Font design was taken from Angela Yu's dice game.

I did not design the images.
Card backing from clipart-library.com
Card faces from https://cactusbush.wordpress.com/2020/08/24/chivalry-or-probability/.

I spent maybe 5-10 hours on this, just adjusting things in the morning before work. I know I could refactor a large amount of it to make it not so long, but it was just to test my skills and see how far I could take it. When I started I thought I would just mess around and see if I could get cards to surface and disappear as I want, but then I decided to take it further. Uploading this because I don't intend on working on it further.
